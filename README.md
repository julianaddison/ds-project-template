>2. Get familiar with the folder structure
>3. From the project directory, run _bash start-up.sh_ which removes all placeholder files
>4. Create an environment through pipenv for your project environment. [What is pipenv?](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/). `pipenv` should be used for python package management. A `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` are provided in this template with some of the most commonly used packages.
>5. Refer to _utils_ folder for common package functions/classes used by the team. If new functions/classes are added or updated, update the template project too.
>6. Refer to [google's style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) when writing code
